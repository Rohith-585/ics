Procedure
1. Implementing WPA2 Security
Log in to the D-Link router interface:
Open a browser and type the router's IP address (e.g., 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1).
Enter the username and password (default is admin for both unless changed).
Navigate to the Wireless tab.
Under the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) section:
Disable WPS if enabled for better security.
Go to Wireless Network Settings:
Set the SSID (WiFi name).
Choose WPA2 in the security options.
Enter a strong passphrase or password.
Save the settings.
Verify the changes by reconnecting to the WiFi network with the new password.
2. Implementing IP-Based Security
Access the D-Link router interface as explained above.
Go to the Advanced tab.
Navigate to the Firewall or IP Filtering section.
Add an IP filtering rule:
Specify the Source IP (device IP to allow/block).
Specify the Destination IP (target router IP or other devices).
Select the appropriate direction (incoming/outgoing traffic).
Save the rule.
Test by checking if the specified IPs are allowed or blocked correctly.
3. Implementing MAC-Based Security
Go to the Advanced tab in the router interface.
Navigate to MAC Filtering under the Wireless Settings section.
Enable MAC Filtering.
Add MAC addresses:
Specify the Source MAC Address (device to allow/block).
Enter the MAC address of the device (can be found using ipconfig /all or ifconfig).
Set the action:
Allow only listed MAC addresses.
Deny listed MAC addresses.
Save the configuration.
Test the network to ensure unauthorized devices are blocked from connecting.
